=========================================================================

DoubleArrayTrie is a pure Java implementation of a double array trie. This
is a radix tree implemented using two arrays to store the transition diagram
instead of pointers/nodes. It is slower for insertions that the graph implementation
but is blazingly fast for retrieval.

There are 4 parts to this project.

One is the implementation of the algorithm itself
found in AbstractDoubleArrayTrie. Extending that is DoubleArrayTrieImpl that implements
the storage management using two ArrayLists - this is done so that additional storage
schemes can be used, such as an odd/even index single array.

The second is examples consisting of a CountTrie that simply implements the
calls from  AbstractDoubleArrayTrie to count insertions and searches. This, along
with the test cases provide usage examples (documentation is currently limited to the
above, the source and the javadocs).

The third is a barebones implementation of a resizing array of integers, because the java
core libraries do not provide collections for primitive values and the overhead from the
wrapper classes is prohibitive. These are found in org.digitalstain.datrie.store

The forth and final part is a preeliminary attempt to provide a wrapper for the common
use case of a trie, i.e. storing strings. It shows succinctly but correctly the assumptions
that underlie the operation of AbstractDoubleArrayTrie and a way to map string using it.

Most of the above will soon be uploaded as a separate documentation project.
